## Basic Arduino Codes

Some of the code from this repository was added within the 3D Emulation Environment, Tikercad.
There is a circuit option that allows you to create simulations of your projects in Arduino.
[Tikercad](www.tinkercad.com/users/8Y2azhRj0FJ-lucas-matheus/)

Several of the examples are from book studies: Basic Arduino by Michael McRoberts.
Other examples are from the websites www.filipeflop.com and www.robocore.net
